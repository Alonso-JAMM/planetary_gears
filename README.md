# Planetary Gears
This workbench is intended to be a planetary gear  calculator for FreeCAD.
It is intended to work similar to [this](http://www.thecatalystis.com/gears/) planetary gear calculator but inside FreeCAD.
It will calculate the gear ratios and will create the gears using FCGear and attachment offsets similar to Assembly4 in order to place the gears.
